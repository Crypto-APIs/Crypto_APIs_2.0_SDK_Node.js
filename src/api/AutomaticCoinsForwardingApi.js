There is also a `minimumTransferAmount` which only when reached will then trigger the forwarding. Through this the customer can save from fees.

Any funds received by this address will be automatically forwarded to `toAddress` based on what the customer has set for the automation.    For this automatic forwarding the customer can set a callback subscription.    {warning}The subscription will work for all incoming transactions until it is deleted.
