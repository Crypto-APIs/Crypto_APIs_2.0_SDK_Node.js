    /**
     * New unconfirmed tokens transactions
     * Through this endpoint customers can create callback subscriptions for a specific event. In this case the event is when there are new unconfirmed tokens transactions for the user. By creating this subscription the user will be notified by Crypto APIs 2.0 when that event occurs. The information is returned per specified address.    Unconfirmed tokens transactions remain in the mempool (memory pool) until they are confirmed by miners and added to the next block. Sometimes spikes in transaction activity can cause delays in confirmations.    {warning}We cannot guarantee at 100% that webhooks for unconfirmed transactions will always be received. Some may **not get received** due to the possibility of some nodes not being updated with that information. This can occur in networks with low activity and/or not many nodes, e.g. Testnet networks and rarely Mainnets.{/warning}    {note}To have an operational callback subscription, you need to first verify a domain for the Callback URL. Please see more information on Callbacks [here](https://developers.cryptoapis.io/technical-documentation/general-information/callbacks#callback-url).{/note}    {note}It is also **important to note** that just because pending unconfirmed transactions are in the mempool, **doesn't necessarily** mean they will get confirmed.{/note}    {warning}Crypto APIs will notify the user **only when** the event occurs. There are cases when the specific event doesn't happen at all, or takes a long time to do so. A callback notification **will not** be sent if the event does not or cannot occur, or will take long time to occur.{/warning}
     * @param {module:model/String} blockchain Represents the specific blockchain protocol name, e.g. Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc.
     * @param {module:model/String} network Represents the name of the blockchain network used; blockchain networks are usually identical as technology and software, but they differ in data, e.g. - \"mainnet\" is the live network with actual data while networks like \"testnet\", \"ropsten\" are test networks.
     * @param {Object} opts Optional parameters
     * @param {String} opts.context In batch situations the user can use the context to correlate responses with requests. This property is present regardless of whether the response was successful or returned as an error. `context` is specified by the user.
