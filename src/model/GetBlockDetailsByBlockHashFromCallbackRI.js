     * @param hash {String} Represents the hash of the block, which is its unique identifier. It represents a cryptographic digital fingerprint made by hashing the block header twice through the SHA256 algorithm.
     * @param height {Number} Represents the number of blocks in the blockchain preceding this specific block. Block numbers have no gaps. A blockchain usually starts with block 0 called the \"Genesis block\".
     * @param previousBlockHash {String} Represents the hash of the previous block, also known as the parent block.
     * @param timestamp {Number} Defines the exact date/time when this block was mined in Unix Timestamp.
     * @param transactionsCount {Number} Represents the total number of all transactions as part of this block.
     * @param difficulty {String} Represents a mathematical value of how hard it is to find a valid hash for this block.
     * @param extraData {String} Represents any data that can be included by the miner in the block.
     * @param gasLimit {String} Represents the amount of gas used by this specific transaction alone.
     * @param gasUsed {String} Represents the exact unit of gas that was used for the transaction.
     * @param minedInSeconds {Number} Specifies the amount of time required for the block to be mined in seconds.
     * @param nonce {String} Represents the sequential running number for an address, starting from 0 for the first transaction. E.g., if the nonce of a transaction is 10, it would be the 11th transaction sent from the sender's address.
     * @param sha3Uncles {String} Defines the combined hash of all uncles for a given parent.
     * @param size {Number} Represents the total size of the block in Bytes.
