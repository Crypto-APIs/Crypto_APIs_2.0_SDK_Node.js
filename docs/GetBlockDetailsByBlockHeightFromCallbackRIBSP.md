## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**difficulty** | **String** | Represents a mathematical value of how hard it is to find a valid hash for this block. | 
**extraData** | **String** | Represents any data that can be included by the miner in the block. | 
**gasLimit** | **String** | Represents the amount of gas used by this specific transaction alone. | 
**gasUsed** | **String** | Represents the exact unit of gas that was used for the transaction. |
