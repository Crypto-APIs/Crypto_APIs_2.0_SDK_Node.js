## getWalletAssetDetails

> GetWalletAssetDetailsR getWalletAssetDetails(blockchain, network, walletId, opts)

Get Wallet Asset Details

Through this endpoint customers can obtain details about a specific Wallet/Vault.

### Example

```javascript
import Cryptoapis from 'cryptoapis';
let defaultClient = Cryptoapis.ApiClient.instance;
// Configure API key authorization: ApiKey
let ApiKey = defaultClient.authentications['ApiKey'];
ApiKey.apiKey = 'YOUR API KEY';
// Uncomment the following line to set a prefix for the API key, e.g. "Token" (defaults to null)
//ApiKey.apiKeyPrefix = 'Token';

let apiInstance = new Cryptoapis.InformativeApi();
let blockchain = ethereum; // String | Represents the specific blockchain protocol name, e.g. Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc.
let network = mainnet; // String | Represents the name of the blockchain network used; blockchain networks are usually identical as technology and software, but they differ in data, e.g. - \"mainnet\" is the live network with actual data while networks like \"testnet\", \"ropsten\", \"rinkeby\" are test networks.
let walletId = 60c9d9921c38030006675ff6; // String | Defines the unique ID of the Wallet.
let opts = {
  'context': "context_example" // String | In batch situations the user can use the context to correlate responses with requests. This property is present regardless of whether the response was successful or returned as an error. `context` is specified by the user.
};
apiInstance.getWalletAssetDetails(blockchain, network, walletId, opts).then((data) => {
  console.log('API called successfully. Returned data: ' + data);
}, (error) => {
  console.error(error);
});

```
