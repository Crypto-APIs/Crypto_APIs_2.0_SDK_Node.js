> GetHDWalletXPubYPubZPubDetailsR getHDWalletXPubYPubZPubDetails(blockchain, extendedPublicKey, network, opts)

Get HD Wallet (xPub, yPub, zPub) Details

HD wallet details is useful endpoint to get the most important data about HD wallet without the need to do a lot of calculations, once the HD Wallet is synced using Sync endpoint we keep it up to date and we calculate these details in advance.

### Example

```javascript
import Cryptoapis from 'cryptoapis';
let defaultClient = Cryptoapis.ApiClient.instance;
// Configure API key authorization: ApiKey
let ApiKey = defaultClient.authentications['ApiKey'];
ApiKey.apiKey = 'YOUR API KEY';
// Uncomment the following line to set a prefix for the API key, e.g. "Token" (defaults to null)
//ApiKey.apiKeyPrefix = 'Token';

let apiInstance = new Cryptoapis.UTXOBasedApi();
let blockchain = bitcoin; // String | Represents the specific blockchain protocol name, e.g. Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc.
let extendedPublicKey = upub5Ei6bRNneqozk6smK7dvtXHC5PjUyEL4ynCfMKvjznLcXi9DQaikETzQjHvJC43XexMvQs64jxB1njMjCHpRZ4xQWAmv3ge9cVtjfsHmbvQ; // String | Defines the account extended publicly known key which is used to derive all child public keys.
let network = testnet; // String | Represents the name of the blockchain network used; blockchain networks are usually identical as technology and software, but they differ in data, e.g. - \"mainnet\" is the live network with actual data while networks like \"testnet\", \"ropsten\", \"rinkeby\" are test networks.
let opts = {
  'context': "context_example", // String | In batch situations the user can use the context to correlate responses with requests. This property is present regardless of whether the response was successful or returned as an error. `context` is specified by the user.
  'derivation': "derivation_example" // String | The way how the HD walled derives, for example when the type is ACCOUNT, it derives change and receive addresses while when the type is BIP32 it derives directly.
};
apiInstance.getHDWalletXPubYPubZPubDetails(blockchain, extendedPublicKey, network, opts).then((data) => {
  console.log('API called successfully. Returned data: ' + data);
}, (error) => {
  console.error(error);
});

```

## syncHDWalletXPubYPubZPub

> SyncHDWalletXPubYPubZPubR syncHDWalletXPubYPubZPub(blockchain, network, opts)

Sync HD Wallet (xPub, yPub, zPub)

HD wallets usually have a lot of addresses and transactions, getting the data on demand is a heavy operation. That&#39;s why we have created this feature, to be able to get HD wallet details or transactions this HD wallet must be synced first. In addition to the initial sync we keep updating the synced HD wallets all the time.

### Example

```javascript
import Cryptoapis from 'cryptoapis';
let defaultClient = Cryptoapis.ApiClient.instance;
// Configure API key authorization: ApiKey
let ApiKey = defaultClient.authentications['ApiKey'];
ApiKey.apiKey = 'YOUR API KEY';
// Uncomment the following line to set a prefix for the API key, e.g. "Token" (defaults to null)
//ApiKey.apiKeyPrefix = 'Token';

let apiInstance = new Cryptoapis.UTXOBasedApi();
let blockchain = bitcoin; // String | Represents the specific blockchain protocol name, e.g. Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc.
let network = testnet; // String | Represents the name of the blockchain network used; blockchain networks are usually identical as technology and software, but they differ in data, e.g. - \"mainnet\" is the live network with actual data while networks like \"testnet\", \"ropsten\", \"rinkeby\" are test networks.
let opts = {
  'context': "context_example", // String | In batch situations the user can use the context to correlate responses with requests. This property is present regardless of whether the response was successful or returned as an error. `context` is specified by the user.
  'syncHDWalletXPubYPubZPubRB': new Cryptoapis.SyncHDWalletXPubYPubZPubRB() // SyncHDWalletXPubYPubZPubRB | 
};
apiInstance.syncHDWalletXPubYPubZPub(blockchain, network, opts).then((data) => {
  console.log('API called successfully. Returned data: ' + data);
}, (error) => {
  console.error(error);
});

```
