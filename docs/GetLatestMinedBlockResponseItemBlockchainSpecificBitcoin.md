## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**difficulty** | **String** | Represents a mathematical value of how hard it is to find a valid hash for this block. | 
**nonce** | **String** | Represents a random value that can be adjusted to satisfy the proof of work | 
**size** | **Number** | Represents the total size of the block in Bytes. | 
**bits** | **String** | A sub-unit of BTC equal to 0.000001 BTC, or 100 Satoshi, and is the same as microbitcoin (Î¼BTC). Bits have two-decimal precision. | 
**chainwork** | **String** | Represents a hexadecimal number of all the hashes necessary to produce the current chain. E.g., when converting 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000086859f7a841475b236fd to a decimal you get 635262017308958427068157 hashes, or 635262 exahashes. |
